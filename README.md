Pokémon Showdown (Prism Edits)
========================================================================

Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code of a fork for the game server of Pokemon Showdown. This code contains edits for the fan game Pokemon Prism.

Installation is not supported, all we are hosting here is the base data, config, and mods along with our edits for collaboration. 

Browser support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pokémon Showdown currently supports, in order of preference:

 - Chrome
 - Firefox
 - Opera
 - Safari 5+
 - IE11+
 - Chrome/Firefox/Safari for various mobile devices

Pokémon Showdown is usable, but expect degraded performance and certain features not to work in:

 - Safari 4+
 - IE9+

Pokémon Showdown is mostly developed on Chrome, and Chrome or the desktop client is required for certain features like dragging-and-dropping teams from PS to your computer. However, bugs reported on any supported browser will usually be fixed pretty quickly.
